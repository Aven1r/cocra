			There is a matrix of size $$$n \times n$$$ which consists of 
				0
			s and 
				1
			s. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. The cell at the intersection of the $$$x$$$-th row and the $$$y$$$-th column is denoted as $$$(x, y)$$$.
			AquaMoon wants to turn all elements of the matrix to 
				0
			s. In one step she can perform the following operation:
			 
				 Select an arbitrary cell, let it be $$$(i, j)$$$, then invert the element in $$$(i, j)$$$ and also invert all elements in cells $$$(x, y)$$$ for $$$x > i$$$ and $$$x - i \ge \left|y - j\right|$$$. To invert a value means to change it to the opposite: 
					0
				 changes to 
					1
				, 
					1
				 changes to 
					0
				. 
			Help AquaMoon determine the minimum number of steps she need to perform to turn all elements of the matrix to 
				0
			s. We can show that an answer always exists.
			Input
			Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
			The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3000$$$).
			The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains a binary string only of characters 
				0
			 and 
				1
			, of length $$$n$$$.
			It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$9\,000\,000$$$.
			Output
			For each test case, print the minimum number of steps.

			Note
			In the first test case, we can use the following scheme:
			 
				 perform the operation on the cell $$$(1, 3)$$$. 
			Clearly, the elements of the initial matrix are not all 
				0
			, so at least one operation is required. Thus, $$$1$$$ is the answer.
			In the second test case, we use the following scheme:
			 
				 perform the operation on the cell $$$(3, 3)$$$; 
				 perform the operation on the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$. 
			It can be shown that there is no way to convert all elements to 
				0
			s in $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ steps, so the answer is exactly $$$2$$$.
