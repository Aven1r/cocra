			A ticket is a non-empty string of digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.
			A 
				lucky
			 ticket is such a ticket that: 
			 
				 it has an even length; 
				 the sum of digits in the first half is equal to the sum of digits in the second half. 
			You are given $$$n$$$ ticket pieces $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$$$. How many pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ (for $$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$) are there such that $$$s_i + s_j$$$ is a 
				lucky
			 ticket? Note that it's possible that $$$i=j$$$.
			Here, the 
				+
			 operator denotes the concatenation of the two strings. For example, if $$$s_i$$$ is 
				13
			, and $$$s_j$$$ is 
				37
			, then $$$s_i + s_j$$$ is 
				1337
			.
			Input
			The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of ticket pieces.
			The second line contains $$$n$$$ non-empty strings $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$$$, each of length at most $$$5$$$ and consisting only of digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.
			Output
			Print a single integer — the number of pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ (for $$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$) such that $$$s_i + s_j$$$ is a 
				lucky
			 ticket.
