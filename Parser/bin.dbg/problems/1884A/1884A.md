			A positive integer is called $$$k$$$-beautiful, if the digit sum of the decimal representation of this number is divisible by $$$k^{\dagger}$$$. For example, $$$9272$$$ is $$$5$$$-beautiful, since the digit sum of $$$9272$$$ is $$$9 + 2 + 7 + 2 = 20$$$.
			You are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$. Please find the smallest integer $$$y \ge x$$$ which is $$$k$$$-beautiful.
			$$$^{\dagger}$$$ An integer $$$n$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$ if there exists an integer $$$m$$$ such that $$$n = k \cdot m$$$.
			Input
			Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
			The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10$$$).
			Output
			For each test case, output the smallest integer $$$y \ge x$$$ which is $$$k$$$-beautiful.

			Note
			In the first test case, numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ consist of a single digit, thus the digit sum is equal to the number itself. None of the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ are divisible by $$$5$$$.
			In the fourth test case, the digit sum of $$$777$$$ is $$$7 + 7 + 7 = 21$$$ which is already divisible by $$$3$$$.
