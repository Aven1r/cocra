			You are given $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n-1}$$$.
			Your task is to construct an array $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ such that:
			 
				 every integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ appears in $$$b$$$ exactly once; 
				 for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$, $$$b_i \oplus b_{i+1} = a_i$$$ (where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operator). 
			Input
			The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).
			The second line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 2n$$$).
			Additional constraint on the input: it's always possible to construct at least one valid array $$$b$$$ from the given sequence $$$a$$$.
			Output
			Print $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$. If there are multiple such arrays, you may print any of them.
